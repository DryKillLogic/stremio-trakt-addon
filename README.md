## Features

### Content in your preferred language

### List management
- Add Trakt lists as catalogs by browsing through **popular**, **trending**, or **search** tabs on the addon configuration page.

### RPDB integration
- Integrate with RPDB, a web service providing posters and ratings for movies and series, enriching the visual and informational content of the catalogs.

### Fanart integration

- Set cache duration for RPDB posters, also adjustable via environment variables, to optimize API usage.
